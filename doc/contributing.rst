Contributing
============

Setting up your environment
---------------------------
First of all, build yourself a nice clean virtual environment using the
:mod:`venv` module (or `virtualenv`_ if you must).  Then pull in the
requirements::

   sphinx-jsondomain$ python3 -mvenv env
   sphinx-jsondomain$ env/bin/pip install -qr requires/development.txt

Giving it Back
--------------
Once you have something substantial that you would like to contribute back
to the extension, push your branch up to github.com and issue a Pull Request
against the main repository.
